\section{Purpose}

In this section we want to introduce briefly our application.\\

The application is developed for the course of \textit{Design and Implementation of Mobile
Applications} of professor Luciano Baresi at Politecnico di Milano.\\
The goal of the course is to design and implement a mobile application on a platform of our choice.
This documents illustrates the decisions we made in order to accomplish this goal.\\

This Software Design Document is a document that provides documentation that will be
used as a overall guidance to the architecture of the software project. In this document we
provide a documentation of the software design of the project, including use case models,
class and sequence diagrams.\\

The purpose of this document is to provide a full description of the design of \textit{MOQA}, a cross-platform application, providing insights into the structure and design of each component.
